What is Postman?
Postman is an API development and testing platform that helps developers build, test, and document APIs more efficiently. 
It is available as a desktop application for Windows, macOS, and Linux, as well as a web-based version.

Key Features of Postman

HTTP Request Builder: Postman allows you to create and send HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to APIs, with the ability to customize headers, query parameters, and request bodies.

Response Viewer: Postman displays the response from the API, including the status code, headers, and response body, making it easier to analyze the API's behavior.

Environment Management: Postman supports the creation of environments, which are sets of variables that can be used across multiple requests. 
This is useful for managing different environments (e.g., development, staging, production) and their respective configurations.

Collection Management: Postman allows you to group related API requests into collections, which can be organized and versioned, making it easier to manage and share your API testing workflows.

Scripting and Automation: Postman supports the use of JavaScript for writing test scripts, automating API workflows, and performing various other tasks.

Documentation: Postman can generate documentation for your APIs, which can be shared with other team members or stakeholders.
